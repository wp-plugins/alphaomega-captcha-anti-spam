The **AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter** plugin is an effective and simple-to-use WordPress plugin that blocks spam and filters posted user **Comments** for inappropriate content.

This plugin can also thwart automated attacks against your **Admin Log In** area. Furthermore, the plugin can be employed flawlessly with Akismet to provide enhanced security features.

Several **Captcha Types** are available, including:

This gives you complete control over which Comments are blocked. Furthermore, you have the option of filtering any or all of the **Comment Form** elements for spam, including **Name**, **E-mail**, **URL**, and **Comment**/**Message**.
