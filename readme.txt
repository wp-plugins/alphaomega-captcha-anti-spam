Provides Visually Appealing Captchas to Enhance and Secure your WordPress pages. Fortified with ANTI-SPAM FILTER Protection and SPAM COUNTER.


== Description ==

The **AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter** provides interesting and unique captchas to enhance and secure your WordPress pages. The **ANTI-SPAM FILTER** included blocks spam and filters posted user **Comments** for inappropriate content. 

Additionally, the new **SPAM COUNTER** feature provides you with an indication of the nature and magnitude of the spamming activity directed against your WordPress pages.

This plugin can also thwart automated attacks against your WordPress **Admin Log In** area, and can be employed flawlessly with Akismet to provide enhanced security features.


Several **Captcha Types** are available, including:

* **Captcha Classica**
* **Captcha Mathematica**
* **Captcha Artistica**
* **Captcha Cinematica**
* **Captcha Literacha**
* **Captcha Scientifica**
* **Captcha Historica**
* **Captcha Acronymica**
* **Captcha Musica**
* **Captcha Geographica**
* **Captcha Numerica**
* **Captcha Sportica**
* **Captcha Directa**
* **Captcha Fashionica**
* **Captcha Economica**
* **Captcha Gastronomica**
* **Captcha Medica**
* **Captcha Ecologica**
* **Captcha Televisica**



Additionally, when the **Anti-Spam Filter** of the plugin is active, **all spam-related Comments and E-mails are blocked, and not sent to you**. This saves you time by automatically stopping these annoying spam Comments and E-mails from cluttering your WordPress Dashboard, thus allowing you to devote your time to more important tasks.

You can create your own **Custom Anti-Spam Filter List** to block all spam Comments from being sent to you. Enter as many spam-related keywords or phrases as you like. This gives you complete control over which Comments are blocked. Furthermore, you have the option of filtering any or all of the **Comment Form** elements for spam, including **Name**, **E-mail**, **URL**, and **Comment** / **Message**.

Alternatively, you may wish to [donate here](http://alphaomegaplugins.com/wordpress-captcha-anti-spam/donate.htm)

Thank you for your kind support.

= How do I know if my WordPress Theme is compatible with the plugin? =

The plugin has been tested with a variety of standard Themes available from the WordPress Themes Repository, some of which are listed on the 'Description' tabsheet of the WordPress [AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/alphaomega-captcha-anti-spam/) site.

Themes that have been modified in any way or that differ from the standard Theme provided by WordPress may not necessarily be compatible and are not supported. Themes provided by third-party sources are not supported.

Hence, the use of standard unmodified WordPress Themes provided by the WordPress Themes Repository is recommended. The best way to determine compatibility is to install the plugin and try it. Most Themes should display the captcha on a single line, while others may display the captcha on two separate lines. This will depend on the particular WordPress Theme being used.

To check that the captcha position on your Comment Form is being displayed appropriately, please view your Comment Form page as a regular web user, and not as Admin, since viewing as Admin may hide certain Comment Form elements such as Name, E-mail and URL.

= I'm using an early version of WordPress. Will the plugin work with WordPress versions below 3.7? =

The plugin should operate flawlessly with most earlier WordPress versions, although I recommend you upgrade to the most recent WordPress version to take advantage of the latest WordPress operational features.

= Can I use the plugin with Akismet? =

Yes. The AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter plugin provides enhanced pre-screening of user-posted comments by employing a combination of customizable captchas and Spam Filter protection. You also have the option of employing either the captcha functionality alone or the Spam Filter alone. Regardless of your choice, the AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter plugin can be used with Akismet to give you added security.
