== Description ==

The **AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter** plugin is an effective and simple-to-use WordPress plugin that blocks spam and filters posted user Comments for inappropriate content. This can dramatically reduce the amount of spam-related Comments sent to you.

There are several **Captcha Types** from which to choose, including:

* **Captcha Mathematica**
* **Captcha Geographica**
* **Captcha Scientifica**
* **Captcha Cinematica**
* **Captcha Historica**

When the Anti-Spam functionality of the plugin is active, **all spam-related Comments are blocked, and not sent to you** - thus saving you time in having to deal with these annoying spam-related Comments.

The AlphaOmega Captcha & Anti-Spam Filter plugin also allows you to place captcha functionality on your WordPress Admin Log In page. This helps prevent automated Admin Log In attacks.

A modification of the traditional captcha that requires the user to enter the name of a capital city or geographical place.


   *  **Captcha Scientifica**

A mutation of the ubiquitous captcha that requires the user to enter an answer to a scientific question or quiz.


   *  **Captcha Cinematica**

A variant of the customary captcha that requires the user to enter the title of a well-known film.
